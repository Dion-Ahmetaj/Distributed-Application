The phole project was implemented in java. Files with path src/main/java/org/example plus the file's name refer to the backend part of the application(implemented via Intellij). The technologies for the backend are TCP sockets, multithreading and synchronization. Also, files with path src/main/java/com/example/myapplication followed by the file's name represent the frontend part (implemented via Android Studio). The technologies for the frontend are TCP sockets and Android UI components (XML layouts).
